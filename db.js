    { term: "Tensiometer", description: "Measuring instrument used to measure the water content of the soil. It isn't easy to automate, because the device is quite fragile and needs constant maintenance.", link: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensiometer_(soil_science)" },
    { term: "LoRa Gateway", description: "A LoRa gateway is a device that receives LoRa signals and forwards them to the internet. It is a device that is connected to the internet and has a LoRa antenna.", link: "https://www.thethingsindustries.com/docs/gateways/" },
    { term: "LoRa", description: "LoRa is a long range, low power wireless technology. It is used for IoT devices, because it is very energy efficient and has a long range. It is used for example in smart meters, smart agriculture and smart cities.", link: "https://lora-alliance.org/about-lorawan" },
    { term: "PCB", description: "A printed circuit board (PCB) mechanically supports and electrically connects electrical or electronic components using conductive tracks, pads and other features etched from one or more sheet layers of copper laminated onto and/or between sheet layers of a non-conductive substrate.", link: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printed_circuit_board" },
    { term: "ESP32", description: "The ESP32 is a low-cost, low-power system on a chip microcontroller with integrated Wi-Fi and dual-mode Bluetooth. It is used in IoT devices, because it is very energy efficient and has a long range. It is made by Espressif Systems.", link: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESP32" },
    { term: "Through-hole soldering", description: "Through-hole technology (also spelled 'thru-hole'), refers to the mounting scheme used for electronic components that involves the use of leads on the components that are inserted into holes drilled in printed circuit boards (PCB) and soldered to pads on the opposite side either by manual assembly (hand placement) or by the use of automated insertion mount machines.", link: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Through-hole_technology" },
    { term: "SMD soldering", description: "Surface-mount technology (SMT) is a method in which the electrical components are mounted directly onto the surface of a printed circuit board (PCB). An electrical component mounted in this manner is referred to as a surface-mount device (SMD).", link: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface-mount_technology" },
    { term: "Surface-mount soldering pad", description: "A soldering pad is a small metal pad that is used to solder a component to a PCB. It is used in surface-mount soldering.", link: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface-mount_technology" },
    { term: "NodeJS", description: "Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, back-end JavaScript runtime environment that runs on the V8 engine and executes JavaScript code outside a web browser.", link: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Node.js" },
    { term: "Line of Sight", description: "Line of sight (LoS) is a type of propagation that can transmit and receive data only where transmit and receive stations are in view of each other without any sort of an obstacle between them.", link: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line-of-sight_propagation" },
    { term: "LoRaWAN", description: "LoRaWAN is a media access control (MAC) protocol for wide area networks. It is designed to allow low-powered devices to communicate with Internet-connected applications over long range wireless connections.", link: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LoRaWAN" },
    { term: "Direcional antenna", description: "A directional antenna or beam antenna is an antenna which radiates or receives greater power in specific directions allowing increased performance and reduced interference from unwanted sources.", link: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directional_antenna" },
    { term: "Solenoid", description: "A solenoid is a coil wound into a tightly packed helix. The term was invented in 1823 by André-Marie Ampère to designate a helical coil. It can be used to control valves or pistons.", link: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solenoid" }
